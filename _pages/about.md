I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/).  Previously, I completed my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering  at [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/).<!--- Here is my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15nmx0AYEzyDuG-Eg7kDtm7bIGg2_xdhA/view?usp=sharing).--> Here are my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0lVZNXIAAAAJ&hl=en), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Binbin_Li14), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/binbli/), GitHub (check [internal](https://github.tamu.edu/BinbinLi?tab=repositories) if your domain is within tamu.edu domain; otherwise, see [external](https://github.com/biinbli/)), and [E-mail](mailto:libinbinhit@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Source%20Han%20Sans).

My research interests include robot perception, behavior planning, scene understanding, localization and mapping for robotics.
